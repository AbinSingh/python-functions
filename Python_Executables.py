1. Write a simple program
2. pip install pyinstaller
3. Generate the Executable
     Once PyInstaller is installed, navigate to the directory where greet.py is saved, then run the following command:
pyinstaller --onefile greet.py
    --onefile: This option tells PyInstaller to bundle everything into a single executable file, making it easier
    to distribute. greet.py: This is the name of the Python script you want to convert into an executable.

4. Locate the Executable
After running the command, PyInstaller will create a few directories and files. Youâ€™ll find the executable file in the
dist directory inside your project folder.
